I've been lurking around the forums for a while now, and read the introduction thread in the off-topic forum. I've decided to join the forum after much consideration, and I hope I can be accepted here.\nMy name is Mortimer, and I'm an 18 year old Dutch guy. I'm a student at the University of Amsterdam, where I study Applied Physics. I'm currently doing a project in the field of computational fluid dynamics, and I'm trying to model some fluid flow problems on the GPU. I'm interested in programming and game development and I'm also a fan of old RPGs.\nI don't know if this introduction is good enough, but I don't want to go into detail. And I'm not going to explain why I want to join this forum either, because I think you can figure out why someone would want to join a forum about programming.\nI'm not a native English speaker, but I think my English is good enough to understand the threads.\nSo, again, I'd like to introduce myself here, and I hope you accept me.\n[EDIT] @pacman: I think I'm allowed to introduce myself here, because I'm not a guest.\nWelcome Mortimer,\nHope you'll enjoy your time on this forum.\n@Mortimer:\nI think you've introduced yourself well, and I'd say you're welcome to join our community. I've moved your post to the proper thread.\nI'm not a native English speaker either, although I'm not interested in becoming one.\nHello Mortimer, welcome to the site\nI'm a native Dutch speaker and live in the city of Eindhoven. I currently work at Philips Research as a software engineer.\nI'm glad to see more people from the Netherlands on the site, welcome!\nOn Thu, 2007-02-08 at 18:04 +0100, Mortimer wrote:\n> So, again, I'd like to introduce myself here, and I hope you accept me.\nWhat do you mean by that? Have you been banned elsewhere?\nI don't think you have to explain why you want to join this forum.\nI'm a native English speaker. I was born and raised in the US (in Los\nAngeles) and currently live in New York City. I'm a computer science\ngraduate student at Columbia University.\n> I'm not a native English speaker, but I think my English is good enough to understand the threads.\nEnglish is your second or third language? I don't think there's\nanything wrong with your English.\n> So, again, I'd like to introduce myself here, and I hope you accept me.\nIf you want to introduce yourself and you can write coherent,\ngrammatically correct English, then I don't think that it matters\nmuch why you want to join the site."]], "offset": 0, "conv_id": "21fa649e74744d58bfef54d6a40f7d02", "model_name": "Llama-2-13b-hf"}, "ip": "127.0.0.1"}
